# Pandas
In this repository there is a Pandas code, which shows examples for the most common functions and commands.

The data comes from a Kaggle dataset, which has wines reviews. The CSV file is uploaded in this repository and the raw link of the file is already in the code, so it works just running the code locally, whithout having to download anything else.

The different parts explained in the code are:
  1. How to create dataframes, read them and write them to a csv file.
  2. Accesing columns or elements using indexes or labels.
  3. Conditional selecting, to get data based on a condition, value or null element.
  4. Summary functions and mapping to rows or columns.
  5. Grouping and sorting, to count or agregate in a similar way to SQL.
  6. Data types and dealing with missing values.
  7. Renaming and combining different CSV files.
